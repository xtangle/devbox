# devbox

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xtangle/devbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xtangle/devbox)

This repository contains Vagrantfile and scripts to set up a local development Virtual Machine running in Linux.
The machine runs on the [Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.1/) distro with a minimal
[Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.net/) desktop environment. It uses the official [ubuntu/bionic64](https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/bionic64) box 
from Ubuntu Cloud Images as the base image.

## What's Installed?

In addition to the default software bundled with Ubuntu, the provisioning process installs the latest versions of the following:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Input](http://input.fontbureau.com/) and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) fonts
- [Tilda](https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda)
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

Programming languages and tools:

Most, if not all listed software will be upgraded to their most recent version upon a `vagrant up` (provisioning is done by default).

## Prerequisites

- A host machine running on Windows.
- [Vagrant 2.0.0+](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) installed.
- [VirtualBox 5.2.0+](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) with the Extension Pack installed.
- VBoxManage.exe exists in the folder `C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox`.
   - This should already be the case if VirtualBox is installed using the default settings.
- Ability to create symbolic links inside shared folders, see [instructions](#enable-creation-of-symlinks-in-shared-folders) below.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure all prerequisites have been met (see previous section).
1. Clone this repo to a directory where you store all your coding projects. 
   - A shared folder will be created linking this directory from the host machine to `${HOME}/Projects` in the guest machine. 
1. Run the command `vagrant up` from the directory of the cloned repository and answer the questions to the interactive prompts.
   - Your answers will be saved in the `.vm-config.yaml` file. They will be used in future Vagrant commands unless the configuration file is outdated or deleted.
   - One of the questions asks to provide a user-specific provisioning script. This is an optional shell script that runs on the guest machine after all other provisioning is finished. 
   - To force to re-configure your VM, either rename or delete the `.vm-config.yaml` file.

## Enable creation of symlinks in shared folders

By default, only administrators on Windows machines are able to create symbolic links. To add your user, follow these steps:

1. Download the tool [Polsedit](http://www.southsoftware.com/) and extract it locally.
1. Open the .exe file in the extracted folder, and add your user to the policy named 'Create symbolic links'.
1. Log out and log back in to your host machine.
